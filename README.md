DHCP/PXE privisioning Ansible role
=============================

This is an Ansible role for configuring PXE/iPXE provisioning, either by
pointing it to en external kickstart source (e.g. Spacewalk) or by provisioning
the kickstart file itself.

This role sets up the following:
 - DHCP iPXE chainbooting
  - DHCP configs for nodes that should be provisioned
  - Generic static DHCP allocations
 - XINETD TFTP server for the chainbooting
 - Apache HTTP server
  - Python script under cgi-bin for handling reprovisioning logic
  - A provisioning directory for provisioning data
  - Optionally kickstart files for the desired groups

Prerequisites
-------------

This role assumes that a ISC DHCP server has been set up by another role.

Usage
-----

This role works by setting up pxe booting based on **groups**. It configures PXE
booting for all hosts in the desired group. By default it's "dhcp_pxe_nodes",
but it can be defined (check defaults/main.yml)

It sets up kickstarts for every ansible **group** under dhcp_pxe_nodes (more details in the Caveats section)

Each host needs the follwing variables in its scope.

Mandatory:
 - mac_address
 - ip_address
 - dhcp_server_ip
 - kickstart_url
 - kernel_url_path (path where kickstart kernel and initrd can be found)

Optional:
 - serialport (for during kickstart)
 - extra_kernel_params (for during kickstart)
 - dhcp_domain
 - memtest86_0_path (for pointing to a memtest.0 PXE NBP)
 - kickstart_grubby_remove_args (for adjusting grub config on default kernel at the end of the kickstart)
 - kickstart_grubby_args
 - yum_proxy (if defined is used also in the url and repo bits of the kickstart)
 - kickstart_lang
 - kickstart_keyboard
 - kickstart_timezone
 - kickstart_log_host
 - dhcp_kickstart_manage_packages
 - kickstart_packages # if dhcp_kickstart_manage_packages is defined then kickstart_packages must contain %packages
 - kickstart_extra_pre_option
 - kickstart_extra_pre_commands
 - kickstart_extra_post_commands

The nodes which only need to be set up for DHCP need to be in the
(by default) "dhcp_only_nodes"  group. These nodes need the following 
variables.

 - mac_address
 - ip_address

The role also configures a per-group kickstart file for each group which has the
"os_disks" variable in its scope. For this it uses the following variables from
the groups context.

Mandatory:
 - install_repo
 - additional_repos
 - root_password_hash
 - os_disks (in the kickstart format, e.g. "sda,sdb")
 - kickstart_partitions (list of kickstart partition instructions)
 - root_keys (public ssh keys to deploy for root)

Optional:
 - kernel_numa_param(can be set to off)

Touch a file to start a reinstall
----------------------

If the hostname of a node you want to PXE / kickstart is computenode1.cloud.example.org then you need to touch either

 - /var/www/provision/memtest86/computenode1
 - or /var/www/provision/reinstall/computenode1

Then when the node boots it will fetch http://ip/cgi-bin/boot.py and that python script will check if that the short hostname of the reverse DNS lookup of the IP/REMOTE_ADDR fetching the file exists and if so return ipxe lines for for example memtest86 or a kickstart reinstall.


Caveats
-------

The role doesn't allow much in the way of kickstart parametrization. It might
make some assumptions on the system state (e.g DHCP config).

The role by default does not install chrony in the kickstart, set variable

<pre>
dhcp_kickstart_install_chrony: True
</pre>

to keep chrony.

Why we use hostvars[groups[item][0]]['variablename'] when templating in the kickstarts
-----

This role sets up kickstarts for every ansible **group** under dhcp_pxe_nodes.

This last bit makes this role a bit different than many other ansible roles.

Templating in the kickstart config files are done per group and not per host.

This is why we use the weird hostvars[groups[item][0]]['variable']

If one were to use the {{ variablename }} and you use ansible groups with parents of parents (grand parents? :)
then the variable that ends up in the final file might vary depending on which parent group gets put earlier
in the ansible python unordered list. If you can make this role work without using hostvars I'll buy you a beer.


Other OS than RHEL
----------

https://github.com/CSCfi/ansible-role-dhcp-kickstart/tree/SoneraCloud_PR_rebase is a PR which has some support for SUSE. It would need quite a bit of work to make it fit with current setup.
